      1. First, link the "Add to list" button to functionality so that any user input can be added to the list
      2. Show the list in the ul tag as separate items
      3. On pressing the Sort button, the list should sort and refresh the view
      4. On pressing search, the phrase entered in the input field should be used to filter the list, leaving only matching items
        4a. Bonus points if you can make this not a complete match (i.e. typing 'ap' will leave 'apple')
      5. Pressing the "count..." button should show the number of words that contain a vowel
